<!--

Hello there.
I see you looking at my source code. That's good! It's one of the best ways to learn how to code.
All the code you see here (bar jQuery and Modernizr) was done by me.

The biggest thing I had trouble with was the nav (Oh God!!!!), trying to get it fully responsive
so it look sweet on those troublesome smartphones, as well on those pesky 1920x1080 monitors!
The article and aside also put up a good fight but I managed to put them back where they belong!

The site is fully responsive, lightweight, has a clean, modern look, and is commmented throughout,
to make the learning process much easier, and to give a bit of insight into why I did what.

Anyways, you better get on with exploring!
Happy coding!

  -Kieran H.
